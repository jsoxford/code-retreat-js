Javascript runner for code retreat

## Getting set up

The first step is to run the script `bin/addToPath.sh`. This will add the JavaScript, Ruby and Python wrappers to your PATH for your current session.

## Local testing
You can use `netcat` to simulate the server and send messages:

```bash
netcat -lp 8787
```

### Messaging

Message formats are described [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/spikeheap/72a6b67bafeb4504fce4).
